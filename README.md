# Labour Statistics Data Pipeline

A personal project demonstrating a data pipeline to process and analyze labor statistics, providing insights into employment trends and job market dynamics. This project uses real-world data from the **United States Bureau of Labor Statistics API** for accurate and reliable information.

## üìÇ Project Overview

This pipeline fetches, processes, and visualizes labor statistics using a variety of employment-related indicators. Users can select data for different **seasonal periods** and choose from multiple **keys representing different employment factors** such as job gains, losses, and net changes.

Additionally, the processed data can be **exported to Excel** and graphs can be **exported across different time series**, making it easy to share insights or integrate with other reporting tools.

The project was built as a demonstration of **data engineering, analysis, and visualization skills**, showcasing how raw labor data can be transformed into actionable insights.
